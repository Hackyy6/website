Hello Iron Fish community! As we lead up to mainnet launch and share updates, we'd like first to recognize all of you. Your support has been motivating, and your feedback has made Iron Fish better.

🙌THANK YOU!🙌

And now, the announcements that you've been waiting for:

-   So that we can focus on mainnet launch and more fairly distribute tokens via our airdrop, we're ending Phase 3 on Feb 24th at 12PST.
-   The Iron Fish mainnet will launch on March 14!!

Here are answers to questions we anticipate and some updates:

### What will you be able to do on 3.14?

All our current capabilities will be live on the mainnet:

-   mining
-   minting
-   burning
-   host a node
-   transactions

### How is Iron Fish celebrating?

March 14 is [Pi day](https://www.piday.org/)! We’ll be hosting a YouTube Live event (more on that soon). We’ll eat some pie, answer some questions from users, and maybe have some sparklers.

We hope you’ll be there to celebrate with us! If you plan to hold your own Iron Fish event, let us know on Discord in the #outreach channel.

### 💪 Update on Trusted Ceremony
