The whole Iron Fish team is so excited to share these mainnet updates with our community. Your support has been motivating, and your feedback has helped make Iron Fish better 💪

🙌 THANK YOU! 🙌

And now, what you’ve been waiting for...mainnet will launch March 14th (3.14)! That’s right, [Pi Day](https://www.piday.org/).

Let’s talk about what that looks like.

### What will you be able to do on 3.14?

All our current capabilities will be available on the live mainnet:

-   mining
-   multi-asset functionality: minting, burning, sending
-   hosting a node
-   transacting

To join in, check out our [getting started guide](https://www.ironfish.network/docs/onboarding/iron-fish-tutorial).

### How is Iron Fish celebrating?

We’ll be hosting a YouTube Live event (more on that soon). We’ll eat some pie, answer some questions from users, and maybe have some sparklers ✨

We hope you’ll be there to celebrate with us! If you plan to have your own Iron Fish party, let us know on Discord in our #outreach channel.

### Update on Trusted Ceremony

We opened our trusted setup to our community on February 13th, and it will run through March 3rd. So far we have over 6600 participants.

We hosted a [YouTube live event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZNuWFB_xbg) with crypto community leaders, so users could hang out with us as they began participating 🎙️
