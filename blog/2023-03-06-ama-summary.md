## Iron Fish Goals and Organization

### What are the key goals for Iron Fish after mainnet?

Elena (CEO): We want Iron Fish to be the privacy platform for crypto. Look at SSL technology. Right now, we are all using HTTPS, which was controversial when it was developed. And we see Iron Fish as that continuation. We want to make Iron Fish fundamental for crypto so that people have the privacy they want without needing to know how the cryptography works.

Phase 3 was about multi-asset, which is the first stepping stone in that direction. We want to partner with bridges so that Iron Fish can interact with other chains and provide privacy to other crypto assets. We want to make Iron Fish more accessible by doing things like building a wallet that helps people easily launch and use Iron Fish ‚Äî and we want to have continuous partnerships with existing projects, existing infrastructure projects, wallets, and other apps to make the integration seamless.
