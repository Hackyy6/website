On February 23, 2023, Iron Fish hosted a [YouTube live session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXPR89Q8jaA) to announce the end of Phase 3 and the mainnet launch date, which is set for March 14, 2023! We also held our first live AMA, where we answered the questions you submitted üéâ

If you missed it, here are the questions by category and a summary of answers.

## Tokenomics, Tokens, and Funding
-   Will you be releasing information about Iron Fish tokenomics? What are the team and investor allocations and vesting periods? What is the total supply, and what will the initial circulating supply be?
-   When will Iron Fish be listed on exchanges? Will there be a public sale?
-   Will there be a series B funding round in the near future?
    
## Use Cases and Growth
-   How is Iron Fish different from its competitors' projects?

## Iron Fish Goals and Organization

### What are the key goals for Iron Fish after mainnet?

**Elena (CEO)**: We want Iron Fish to be the privacy platform for crypto. Look at SSL technology. Right now, we are all using HTTPS, which was controversial when it was developed. And we see Iron Fish as that continuation. We want to make Iron Fish fundamental for crypto so that people have the privacy they want without needing to know how the cryptography works.

Phase 3 was about multi-asset, which is the first stepping stone in that direction. We want to partner with bridges so that Iron Fish can interact with other chains and provide privacy to other crypto assets. We want to make Iron Fish more accessible by doing things like building a wallet that helps people easily launch and use Iron Fish ‚Äî and we want to have continuous partnerships with existing projects, existing infrastructure projects, wallets, and other apps to make the integration seamless.

### Where do you see Iron Fish in five years?
**Lawrence (Engineering Manager)**: Right now, private transactions on blockchains account for less than 1% of overall transaction volume. So if you start with the assumption that blockchain and crypto transactions will move towards privacy, just as HTTP moved towards HTTPS, that's a huge opportunity that we are excited to tackle. We're very early and that this transaction volume is going to go from well under 1% to over 50%. There will be many winners in this space and lots of really interesting developments ‚Äî and we're on the ground floor of it.

### What are some of Iron Fish's biggest challenges, and how have you addressed them?
**Jason (Principal Engineer)**: First and foremost, building a new layer-1 is extremely difficult. It's very, very hard. My general push on the engineering team is to build something simple that works well and expand it from there.

Elena said that Mainnet launch is not the end for iron Fish. I would rather cut down on features, build something incredibly stable, and then expand it.

**Mat (Engineer)**: The biggest challenge is that privacy is hard to get right. We had to build some new zero-knowledge proof circuits, which, if built incorrectly, can lead to leaks or diminish privacy. So we spent a considerable amount of time making sure those were as good as possible. Everything's harder if you're concerned about privacy because you have to make sure there are no obvious attack vectors.

**Jason**: Iron Fish is innovating in core privacy and other ways. We have some new, interesting P2P networking where we support Web Sockets and WebRTC. Derek, would you like to speak about this?

**Derek (Engineer)**: With many other tokens, nodes make a simple direct connection. We have multiple types of connections that can be made, and the node will kind of switch between them depending on what's available and what allows two different people to be connected. Some of the challenges that we'll be looking at include:

-   How do you figure out who to download blocks from to get blocks the fastest?
-   Should you switch to somebody else when the person you're downloading blocks from slows down?
-   When a new block is mined or a transaction is created, how do you get that out to the network as fast as possible?
    
Fortunately, since we're in the open source space, we have the advantage of looking at other solutions that people have come up with and combining that with our individual ideas to make something that works.

**Yajun (Engineer)**: We are building an innovative product, and there are not many L1 privacy chains. So whenever we want to build a feature or solve a problem, we can't just go on Google and get the answer. The whole team is navigating through the unknown, and we need to figure out the best solutions for our use case.

**Jason**: Speaking on that, a lot of people on [Discord](https://discord.ironfish.network/) are wondering why their mint, burn, and send orders are not being processed. As long as your mint burn and send transactions are confirmed on the blockchain, they will get credit when we count the points.

**Elena**: One of the biggest challenges is safely launching a privacy project. Privacy is a double-edged sword. Take Tornado Cash, which was a privacy solution for Ethereum sanctioned by OFAC, which is part of the US regulatory government. That was because North Korean hackers were using Tornado Cash to launder money.

A challenge for Iron Fish relates to how we communicate to regulators that what we are building is to protect consumers and protect crypto users with privacy. We are not building this for the bad actors of the world.

### I don't understand how you're a privacy company but acting centralized.
**Elena**: So I can interpret that question as: is it okay for a decentralized project to be VC funded? And the answer to that is yes. Humble brag, I think our engineering team is amazing. I think we have some great talent and would not be able to make up this team if we were not funded. That's just the truth of it. In this format, we're able to build the best product with the best people.

### How do you maintain such positivity in the team? It seems that you're always interested in working together with the community.

**Lawrence**: The way we do this is by hiring people who really care about this project. We have talked to so many engineers in the crypto space to find the right set of people to bring this project forward. And we have, in many ways, accomplished that. It bleeds through, into Discord, our community, and everything we do. This kind of passion brings in a passionate community, a positive community. And I'm personally really, really proud of that.
