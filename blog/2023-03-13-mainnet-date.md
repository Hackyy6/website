We have an important mainnet update — we are delaying the Iron Fish mainnet to April 20, 2023.

Our mission has always been to create the strongest privacy layer-1 possible, and have put our codebase through rigorous tests. In this process, we found a bug that needs to be fixed before we can launch mainnet.

We appreciate your support and patience while we resolve the issue. This delay also means testnet participants will have more time to complete KYC; please see the information below for updated deadlines.

### Incentivized Testnet Rewards

As of March 13th, we have opened the [Redemption Portal](https://testnet.ironfish.network/dashboard/rewards) to all participants, regardless of phase.

New dates and deadlines:

-   The new KYC deadline is April 14, 2023
-   The airdrop for all eligible recipients will be April 21, 2023

We recommend completing the process well before the deadline to leave ample time to address any issues. If you run into any issues while doing KYC or have questions, please visit [Discord](https://discord.ironfish.network/). US residents, please read [our statement](https://testnet.ironfish.network/faq#us-token-distribution) on our website
