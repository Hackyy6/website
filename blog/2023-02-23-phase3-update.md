Phase 3 has been, to put it mildly, an incredible success:

-   We have over 38k users in Discord
-   Users have minted [over 300k assets](http://www.oreoscan.info/en/assets)
-   The network has hosted almost 60k concurrent nodes (check out our stats [here](https://stats.ironfish.network/?orgId=1))

The community has been running nodes, minting, burning, sending, and ensuring we are able to make Iron Fish stronger 🙌 We’re proud to report that our multi-asset functionality has passed the stress test.

While we have loved seeing Phase 3 succeed, it’s also meant that an incredible amount of traffic has been coming into our system. This traffic is taking down our API frequently and costing a fair amount of engineering time to fix (in addition to frustrating users). We have a lean team, and these fixes take time from prepping for mainnet.

For all these reasons, we’ve decided to end Phase 3 early. Instead of March 7th, Phase 3 will now end on Saturday, February 25th.

## What’s Next?

We put our community first, and firmly believe that this earlier end date will provide a better experience, especially as we hear reports of users struggling to fully participate in the face of outages.

Please stay tuned for mainnet updates via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ironfishcrypto) and [Discord](https://discord.ironfish.network). We look forward to continue chatting with you on Discord and answering your questions as we build 🙏
