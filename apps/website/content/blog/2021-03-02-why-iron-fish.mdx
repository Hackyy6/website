## Why the name 'Iron Fish'?

During World War 2, the US recruited Native Americans to use their tribal
languages to send secret communications to and from the battlefield
– a system that was unbroken until it was declassified in the late
60s.

One of their code systems contained words that were directly
translated from English to Navajo for common military words. Certain
modern military words didn’t have a direct translation to Navajo,
and so they had to improvise. The term for ‘submarine’ therefore
became what directly translates to as ‘iron fish’.

We chose this as our name because it shows the power of
cryptography, how a complex modern concept can be described using
relatively simple words, and it even has two tradable commodities
(iron and fish) right in its name.
