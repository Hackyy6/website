## Create a new account

By default, your node creates an account when you start up your node for the first time. You can create a new account at any time with the following command:

```sh
ironfish wallet:create
```

<Terminal
  command="ironfish wallet:create"
  output={`Creating account MyNewAccount

Account MyNewAccount created with public address
6a085865ac5608c8ec64189db54d4b5c085da9da12dad0a0bf00f60e52c16b0303d8a8dd7d82601f577c8d

Run "ironfish wallet:use MyNewAccount" to set the account as default`}
/>

## Set the account as default

When you have multiple accounts you can set which account to use as the default account:

```sh
ironfish wallet:use MyNewAccount
```

## Next steps

You can read about the different wallet commands in [the wallet section](wallet.md).

Now that you have created an account you can [receive transactions](transactions.md#receive-a-transaction) or [start mining $IRON](mine.md).
