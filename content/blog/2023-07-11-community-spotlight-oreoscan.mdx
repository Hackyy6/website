I am extremely excited for this special community spotlight on [Oreoscan](https://www.oreoscan.info/en), the independent community driven block explorer for Iron Fish that launched months before mainnet during Phase 2 of the Incentivized Testnet. The creator behind Oreoscan is a long time standing member of the Iron Fish community: Fishguy on Discord.

We asked Fishguy to explain more about Oreoscan in his own words, what inspired him to build on Iron Fish, and some of the future plans for the project.

*‚ÄúOreoscan, as a comprehensive blockchain explorer for Iron Fish that prioritizes user privacy and data security‚Äù.*

Today, users can use Oreoscan‚Äôs intuitive and user-friendly UI to explore Iron Fish network metrics, block and transaction feeds, as well as all the [private custom assets](https://www.oreoscan.info/en/assets) that have been created on Iron Fish so far. In addition to the [official block explorer](https://explorer.ironfish.network/) for Iron Fish, users are able to verify transactions, blocks, and network stats by consulting a secondary independent block explorer.

## Oreoscan + Iron Fish

We asked Fishguy directly on *why* they specifically chose to work on Iron Fish:

*We chose to use Iron Fish for our project due to its **strong emphasis on privacy** and security. Iron Fish's implementation of zk-SNARK technology ensures maximum security across the platform, aligning with our goal of providing a secure and private blockchain explorer.*

Oreoscan and Iron Fish share a focus on **privacy** and security, which was a big factor for them:

*Iron Fish has facilitated the implementation of crucial features such as **encryption of transaction data, read-only view keys for users, and the ability to securely share account information**. These features are instrumental in maintaining the privacy and security of user transactions while still enabling compliance and proof of transaction when necessary.*

At Iron Fish, we aim to continue building the project in a way that promotes decentralization and durability, something that the Oreoscan team has also emphasized:

*Additionally, Iron Fish's decentralized network of miners and nodes provides resilience and censorship resistance, contributing to the overall reliability of our application.*

Personally, one of the most encouraging aspects of working on Iron Fish is the global community of members all around the world who are dedicated to privacy and aligned with Iron Fish‚Äôs vision of bringing privacy to crypto. One of the most powerful things when working on open source projects is getting that positive feedback from the community.

*During the integration process with Iron Fish, we encountered some unexpected benefits. **One significant benefit was the positive response from the Iron Fish community**.*

*We have received encouraging feedback from users, the development team, partners, and the Iron Fish community regarding the capabilities of Oreoscan. Users appreciate the intuitive user interface, the ability to explore transactions privately, and the seamless integration with Iron Fish.*

*The Iron Fish community has expressed their enthusiasm for a dedicated blockchain explorer that aligns with their privacy-centric values.*

Positive feedback and appreciation for open source work goes a long way‚Äîif you use Oreoscan and see Fishguy on Discord, please feel free to give him a shoutout!

## Future for Oreoscan

Even though Oreoscan is fully available, according to Fishguy it‚Äôs only ‚Äú*in the early stages of its roadmap‚Äù.* They view this version as just ‚Äú*the initial version of our blockchain explorer.‚Äù*

*Moving forward, we plan to expand our feature set, collaborate with other projects to enhance security disclosures, and facilitate address-based communication between users.*

## Building on Iron Fish

We want to make sure that building tools for Iron Fish is as easy as possible, and so we asked Fishguy for feedback on the process of building Oreoscan:

*While being an independent project, we have received support and guidance from Iron Fish, which has played a pivotal role in shaping our development and ensuring compatibility with their network.*

***The Iron Fish team has been incredibly supportive throughout the integration process of Oreoscan**. They provided us with technical documentation, guidance, and access to their development resources. We had regular communication and collaboration sessions with the Iron Fish team, where we discussed implementation details, best practices, and addressed any challenges that arose. **Their expertise and responsiveness played a crucial role in ensuring a smooth integration of Oreoscan with the Iron Fish network**. We are grateful for their support and collaboration during this process.*

I want to give a huge thank you to Fishguy and for anyone else who contributed to the Oreoscan team. Thank you for being an incredible community member and bolstering the Iron Fish ecosystem.
