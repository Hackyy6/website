Today we're excited to announce the initial release of the Iron Fish Wallet Server. This project aims to enable the building and running of a fully private light client without the need to run a local Iron Fish node. In this blog post, we'll provide an overview of the Wallet Server, its key features, and talk about how you can help us improve this project.

## TL;DR:

- The Iron Fish Wallet Server is a gRPC server that allows light clients to interact with the Iron Fish network without having to run a full node.
- The Wallet Server is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/iron-fish/wallet-server).
- If you're interested in building a light client, talk to us over on Discord on the [#wallet-server](https://discord.com/channels/771503434028941353/1153438621534277785) channel!

## Why do we need a Wallet Server?

Iron Fish is a privacy-first cryptocurrency that uses zero-knowledge proofs to provide fully private transactions. This means that the Iron Fish network does not publicly display any information about the sender, receiver, or amount of a transaction. The only person who has access to this data is the person who has the private keys for the account of interest. This is very different than other blockchains like ethereum and bitcoin where anyone can see this data for any account. With the current architecture, it also means that you need to run a full node to privately interact with the network. This makes it difficult to use Iron Fish on a mobile device, browser, or any low power machine.

The Wallet Server solves this problem by acting as a proxy between the light client and the full node. The Wallet Server is beneficial for both Iron Fish nodes, and light clients. For nodes, it reduces the number of incoming requests, and light clients will retrieve all the information necessary to construct their account information without having to run a node.

## How does the Wallet Server work?

The Wallet Server is a gRPC server that talks to one or more Iron Fish nodes. It gets blocks from the Iron Fish nodes, caches them, and provides endpoints to light clients so that they can retrieve the cached blocks.

Light clients can request the latest block, a specific block by hash or sequence, or a range of blocks. The Wallet Server also provides an endpoint for light clients to submit transactions to the network. Note that the transactions received and sent via the wallet server are still completely private.

## Get involved

The Wallet Server project is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/iron-fish/wallet-server). The repository contains the Wallet Server code, as well as an example client that demonstrates how to use the Wallet Server. The example client is not intended for production use, but it can be used as a reference when building your own client.

This project is still in its early stages, and we're looking for feedback from the community. If you're interested in building a light client, talk to us over on Discord on the [#wallet-server](https://discord.com/channels/771503434028941353/1153438621534277785) channel!
