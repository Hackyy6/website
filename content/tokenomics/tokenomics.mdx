Iron Fish is a Layer-1 chain based on Proof of Work. _Every single_
Iron Fish transaction is encrypted, hiding sensitive user information on who
the sender, recipient, or the amount of transaction was with an accompanying
zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). Every Iron Fish wallet has a private key, public
key, and a viewing key. The creator of the wallet has the ability to share
out this view key and reveal their transactional history.

Our mission is for Iron Fish to be the privacy layer for _all_
crypto, letting assets from other chains be transferred over to Iron Fish to
gain the benefit of privacy. The Iron Fish community spans countries,
languages, and backgrounds ‚Äî including miners, engineers, and privacy
advocates.

The Iron Fish Incentivized Testnet ran December 2021 - February 2023 in
three phases; during Phase 2, we surpassed 39m fully shielded transactions,
making Iron Fish one of the largest processor of ZKPs.

Mainnet launches April 20, 2023.

## Token Supply &amp; Distribution Data

In this document, we present a breakdown of our token supply and
distribution. Note that this is a high level overview ‚Äî we provide
visualizations as often as possible, but there is nuance within distribution
that may not be within the scope of this post. We have rounded numbers where
necessary for better overall understanding.

## Context &amp; Definitions

- **Genesis Block:** The first block in the Iron Fish blockchain. The Iron Fish genesis block includes 42M tokens.
- **Emissions Curve:** The Emissions curve describes how the total supply changes over time due to token economics. For Iron Fish, every time a miner mines a block, they are rewarded with new coins that contribute to an inflation schedule, meaning that with each block the total supply of tokens increases. More on the emissions curve below.
- **Circulating Supply:** The total number of coins that are available for transfer (not locked up).

## Emissions Curve

The mining reward (how many coins a miner is allocated for successfully
mining a block) is tied to the Iron Fish emissions curve. The emissions
curve starts out with 42M coins in the genesis. After the first year, the
total for new coins created due to mining rewards is 1/4th of the genesis,
or 10.5M coins. Every subsequent year fewer and fewer coins will be created,
until a terminal supply of 256,970,400 coins is reached (roughly at year 150
post genesis).

The formula to determine how many new coins will be minted for a particular
year after launch is:

<Img src="/images/tokenomics/01-mint-formula.avif" maxWidth="400px" />

Where <em>s</em> is the initial supply of the genesis block of 42 million
coins, <em>k</em> is the decay factor of -.05, and <em>x</em> is the year
after mainnet launch (starting from 0).

The Iron Fish ‚Äúyear‚Äù in block count is 525,600 blocks to one calendar year
(assuming 60-second block times). We use the above formula to calculate the
block reward using the Iron Fish "year", rounded to the nearest .125 of a
coin:

<Img src="/images/tokenomics/02-block-reward.avif" maxWidth="600px" />

Therefore, the block reward and total supply for the first few years after
launch would be:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <strong>Years after launch</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Block reward (60s block times)</strong>
      </th>
      <th>
        <strong>Total supply</strong>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>42,000,000.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>0-1</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>52,512,000.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1-2</td>
      <td>19</td>
      <td>62,498,400.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2-3</td>
      <td>18.125</td>
      <td>72,024,900.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The emissions curve using the block reward formula mentioned above, with a
cap of 256,970,400 coins for total supply, would look like this:

The inflation graph below shows how the circulating supply is redistributed.

Unlike most Proof-of-Stake Layer-1s, Iron Fish has aggressive inflation in
the first couple of years ‚Äî this shifts the majority of token supply to
miners and other community members more quickly.

## Allocation &amp; Supply Overview

The Iron Fish genesis block contains 42M tokens. We provide a deeper look at
these sections later in the article.

The chart below shows the 4-year circulating supply.

Relevant notes:

- For every insider (investor, advisor, employee) there is a 1-year lock-up period, meaning that no tokens can be traded or transferred by an insider for 12 months after the mainnet event.
- For every insider (investor or employee) <em>vested tokens</em> will become eligible for transfer monthly over a 24-month period (including the mandatory 12-month lock-up period) post mainnet.
- For every employee there is a 4 year vesting, 1 year cliff on top of the lockup schedules.

We can also look at the genesis block broken up over the next few years.

As time goes on, the vast majority of coins will be in the hands of miners and other community members, as shown in the graph below.

## Genesis Block Category Explanations

_Note: As noted above, all insiders have 12 month lockup, followed by an 12 month unlock period. This includes investors, employees, and advisors._

### Iron Fish Foundation ‚Äî 18%

The tokens allocated to the Iron Fish Foundation (founded on April 20th,
2023) are to enable the Foundation in its goal of engaging and growing the
Iron Fish community, encouraging ecosystem growth, and increasing open
source development

### Testnet Airdrop ‚Äî 2.25%

The <em>Testnet Airdrop</em> consists of 945,000 tokens distributed to
eligible testnet participants.

### Future Airdrops ‚Äî 2.25%

These tokens are being held by the Iron Fish Foundation for future community
incentivization and engagement. The Foundation is committed to distributing
the airdrops impartially, within any associated parameters. While we do not
currently have specifics for these airdrops, your best bet to be an active
and contributing community member.

### Series Preseed ‚Äî 5.1%

None of this would have been possible without the financial support and
continuous mentoring of our preseed investors. Thank you üôè.

### Series Seed ‚Äî 9.9%

When Iron Fish needed to grow, these investors were there to help. In this
round we welcomed Electric Capital, Balaji, and other leaders in the crypto
space.

### Series A ‚Äî 14.5%

a16z Crypto, Sequoia, and Elad Gil led our Series A. Their belief in us
provided the resources to accelerate towards mainnet.

### IF Labs ‚Äî 5%

IF Labs is a wholly independent company, focused on building and maintaining
the Iron Fish product. IF Labs will be able to use its portion of the
genesis block to appeal to talent, incentivizing top developers to join.
Guided and advised by the community, IF Labs developers and creators will
expand the Iron Fish ecosystem and ensure it only grows stronger.

### Future Endowment ‚Äî 5%

This additional supply of tokens for the Iron Fish Foundation will help
ensure continued Foundation operation. It is subject to the 12 month
