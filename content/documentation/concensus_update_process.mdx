title: Concensus Update Process
description: Concensus Update Process | Iron Fish Blockchain

To maintain consensus, all full nodes validate blocks using the same consensus rules. However, sometimes the consensus rules are changed to introduce new features or prevent network abuse. A hard fork will be performed when the new concensus rules are introduced. Hard fork creates
a permanent divergence in the block chain, where non-upgraded nodes canâ€™t validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules.

### Requirement for Hard fork
1. Hard Fork FIP, including the full list of changes in the concensus
2. New randomness for the circuit if trust setup is required for the hard fork

### Hard Fork Process
1. Pick hard fork activation block sequence
2. Get approval for the hard fork FIP
3. Make testnet block activation PR 
4. Release and deploy to testnet 
5. Make announcement about the testnet hard fork 
6. Testnet upgrade window
7. Testnet activation 
8. Make mainnet block activation PR 
9. Release and deploy to mainnet 
10. Make announcement about the mainnet hard fork 
11. Mainnet upgrade window
12. Mainnet activation 

### Hard Fork Upgrade Window
We aim to give a 1-week for testnet upgrad window and 3-weeks for mainnet upgrade window. During the upgrad window, we will proactivly encourage miners, exchanges, wallet providers and node users to upgrade to the new version.
