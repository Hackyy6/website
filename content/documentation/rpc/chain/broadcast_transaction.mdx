Broadcast a fully built, serialized transaction to the node's peers. This is useful for broadcasting custom built transactions.

This is a one time broadcast. The transaction will not be rebroadcasted automatically like it would if it were created in the wallet.

#### Request

```js
{
  transaction: string;
}
```

#### Response

```js
{
  hash: string;
}
```
